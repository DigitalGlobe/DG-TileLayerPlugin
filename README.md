# TileLayerPlugin

TileLayerPlugin is a QGIS plugin to view Pseudo Mercator projected tile maps.

## How to use?

After installing this plugin, you can add tile layers onto your map canvas from the layer menu or the manage layers toolbar. Only tile frame layers are listed until you add layer information by yourself. You can add available layers by writing a file in the format described below and setting the folder that the file exists as external layer directory.

A few layer styles can be changed in the layer properties dialog. You can set sufficient cache size (in kilobytes) in the Network/Cache Settings of the Options dialog in order to make effective use of cache.

### Limitations
With this plugin, you can view only **WGS 84 / Pseudo Mercator** projected tile maps. Tile layers don't appear when the coordinate reference system is not **EPSG:3857**.

### Layer information file format
Layer information file is a text file. Each line has information for a tile layer. Fields are separated with tab character. The file extension is **tsv** and the file encoding is UTF-8.

**Line format is:**  
`title  credit  url  yOriginTop  zmin  zmax  xmin  ymin  xmax  ymax`

**Description of fields:**  
Required
* title: Layer title
* credit: Credit specified by tile map service provider.
* url: URL of tile map. Special strings "{x}", "{y}" and "{z}" will be replaced with tile coordinates and zoom level that are calculated with current map view.

Options
* yOriginTop: Origin location of tile matrix. 1 if origin is top-left (Google Maps compatible), 0 if origin is bottom-left (TMS). Default is 1.
* zmin, zmax: Minimum/Maximum value of zoom level. Default values: zmin=10, zmax=15.
* xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax: Layer extent in degrees (longitude/latitude). Note: Valid range of y in Pseudo Mercator projection is from about -85.05 to about 85.05.

You should correctly set zmin, zmax, xmin, ymin, xmax and ymax in order not to send unnecessary requests to tile map servers.

### Examples of layer information file
* **For a tile map provided by a HTTP server that you may access**  
freetilemap.tsv  
`RoadMap	FreeTileMap	http://freetilemap.example.com/road/{z}/{x}/{y}.png	1	0	19`

* **For a tile map generated by gdal2tiles.py**  
slope.tsv  
`slope	local	file:///d:/tilemaps/slope/{z}/{x}/{y}.png	0	6	13	130.5	33.6	135.0	36.0`

Note: Use tab character to separate fields!

## ChangeLog
